# ShaDonnas List - Rate the Block

TechStack

The whole technical Vision for the Project

When a web3company/DAO signs with us they will get a membership NFT, which will store the info but will also be linked to the rating they get. When signing up they can choose a certain amount of NFTs they are planning to distribute to their community. These NFTs will serve as a Proof of Relationship.

As this is a web3 application and privacy is our highest priority especially as our product will be directed at marginalised communities, we will use ZK Proof to offer anonymity.
So we want the rating that should be of course immutable not be related to the user-address
For this ZK Proof of Relationships we will use a copy of tornadocash, to proof that the user holds an NFT related to the companies/DAOs membership NFT.

We'll build the app using Polygon because we'll need a low-cost blockchain to deploy a large number of NFTs. To deploy the contract to the blockchain we will use DataHub by Figment.

However, because this is just one use-case, it might serve as a prototype for a generic rating platform. in a more advanced application,we would not issue the proof of relation as it would be tied to the product, such as receipts for shopping, restaurants, business contracts, and employment.

For this we need a multi-chain approach, so we would also build on NEAR and Solana as well. We could utilize [https://neon-labs.org/](https://neon-labs.org/) so we wouldn’t have to rewrite tornadocash for Solana.

Because total decentralisation is important to us:

As we care about complete decentralization :

- We will deploy our frontend on Skylabs
- Membership NFTs, as well as the related ratings, will be stored on StorJ

Our product will also be able to serve the web3companies in the sense that they will receive feedback data that our company harvest based on the ratings. It would be an interesting use-case to use Lukka for the data analysation and improve DAOs and web3 companies through that. [https://lukka.tech/enterprise-data](https://lukka.tech/enterprise-data)

The PROJECT

1. ShaDonna’s list is the number one Web3 rating and surveying resource that provides proof of relationship with zero knowledge verification for users. This enables the web3 community to share business and service experiences in a decentralized way. This rating system keeps a transparent and honest Web3 community through our membership NFT gated 3rd party rating system.
2. This project leverages technology well, utilizing multiple sponsor’s Web3 resources into one original application, including Storj, Figment, Coinbase Wallet, Polygon, Starknet, The Graph and NEAR.
3. Although this initial project is targeted for the Web3 community, the technology utilized is scalable and can be used to enhance the broader rating and survey industry for all service and product industry verticals, thus providing usefulness in the real world.
4. Our team started with 3 women on Friday who ideated this concept. It then evolved to 5 on Saturday putting forth a tremendous effort in which the tech stack and pitch was developed for Sunday’s presentation.
5. We solve the problem of survey anonymity. Postings and ratings in Web2 can be submitted by unvaried customers to allow for anonymity, but sacrificing integrity of verification of connection to the actual company being rated.
6. We disrupt the traditional centralized user rating systems. Currently, there exists no user rating system that is decentralized.
7. We uniquely provide a trusted 3rd Party Equality rating. Web3 industry’s egalitarian panacea reputation is tarnished by lack of equity and companies' clear solution path to resolve it falling short on its promise of forging a democratizing force.
8. Provide Web3 companies feedback from data harvested from ratings.
9. A Web3 application with privacy is its highest priority directed at marginalized communities, utilizing ZK Proof to offer anonymity.
10. NFTs providing Proof of Relationship.
11. Storage of NFTs on a decentralized cloud enables NFTs that are more secure, automatically globally redundant and immutable with a Story-hosted IPFS-dedicated node.
